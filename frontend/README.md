## Features

- Interactive research interface with real-time progress tracking
- Configurable research strategies
- Support for both V1 and V2 API endpoints
- Dry run mode for testing
- Real-time report generation and viewing

## Configuration

The frontend application is highly configurable through environment variables. Copy the example environment file and customize it for your deployment:

```bash
cp env.example .env.local
```

### Environment Variables

#### Backend API Configuration

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_BASE_URL`: The base URL of your backend server (default: `http://localhost`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_PORT`: The port your backend server is running on (default: `8000`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_VERSION`: API version to use - `v1` or `v2` (default: `v2`)

#### Runtime Configuration

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DRY_RUN`: Enable dry run mode - `true` or `false` (default: `false`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_V2_API`: Enable V2 API - `true` or `false` (default: `true`)

#### Frontend Configuration

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_PORT`: The port for the frontend development server (default: `3000`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_HOST`: The host for the frontend development server (default: `localhost`)

### Example Configuration

For a production deployment with a backend on a different server:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_BASE_URL=http://your-backend-server.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_PORT=8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_VERSION=v2
NEXT_PUBLIC_DRY_RUN=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_V2_API=true
```

For local development:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_BASE_URL=http://localhost
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_PORT=8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_VERSION=v2
NEXT_PUBLIC_DRY_RUN=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_V2_API=true
```

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**

   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your configuration
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build the application for production
- `npm run start` - Start the production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Backend Requirements

This frontend requires a compatible backend server running the NVR Universal Deep Research API. The backend should:

- Support both `/api/research` (V1) and `/api/research2` (V2) endpoints
- Accept POST requests with JSON payloads
- Return Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time progress updates
- Support the dry run mode parameter

## Deployment

The application can be deployed to any platform that supports Next.js:

1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Start the production server: `npm run start`
3. Set the appropriate environment variables for your deployment

### Example Deployment Platforms

- **Vercel**: Connect your Git repository and set environment variables in the dashboard
- **Netlify**: Build and deploy with environment variable configuration
- **Railway**: Deploy with automatic environment variable management
- **Self-hosted**: Run on your own server with proper environment configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Backend Connection Errors**: Ensure your backend server is running and the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_BASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_PORT` are correctly configured.

2. **CORS Errors**: Make sure your backend server allows requests from your frontend domain.

3. **API Version Issues**: If you're experiencing API compatibility issues, try switching between `v1` and `v2` using the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_VERSION` environment variable.

### Development Tips

- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_DRY_RUN=true` during development to avoid making actual API calls
- The application supports hot reloading - changes to your code will be reflected immediately
- Check the browser console for detailed error messages
